question: "What is Headless CMS ?"
---

_A headless CMS is a content management system that manages and organizes content without a connected front-end or display layer.
Then, you use a content API to distribute that content to anywhere and everywhere you need it â€” your website, your mobile app,
your email marketing, your CRM, etc._
